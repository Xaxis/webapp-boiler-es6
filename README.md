## Summary

Scaffolding for rapidly building node/backbone based web applications.

I'm continually building different web applications/single page web applications based on Node and Backbone. Through 
these experiences I'm continually refining my processes. One effort towards increased efficiency is spinning up a new 
project as quickly as possible.

This repo variation includes scaffolding to quickly create projects using ES6.
